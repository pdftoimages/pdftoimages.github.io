## 📰 Introduction – Why Convert PDF to Images?

PDFs are great for documents, but they're not ideal for quick sharing as images, previews, or on social media. That’s where **PDF to image conversion** becomes useful.

By turning each page of a PDF into an image (JPG or PNG), you can:

- Embed document pages into websites
- Share content on platforms like Instagram, Twitter, or LinkedIn
- Generate document thumbnails or previews
- Use PDF slides as images in presentations
- Send PDFs as readable images via chat apps

This tool lets you do all of that — with **no upload limits** and **no privacy concerns**, because everything runs right in your browser.
